 Digital Art Gallery: Interactive Frontend Showcase
A responsive and visually dramatic digital art gallery built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This project features a horizontal thumbnail strip that uses a unique hover-to-center scroll effect for seamless browsing. Clicking a thumbnail opens a stylish, two-panel lightbox overlay to display the high-resolution image and detailed information.

Key Features:
Atmospheric Design: Dark, fixed background with a stylized fixed heading.

Interactive Scrolling: Thumbnails automatically center in the viewport on hover.

Detailed Lightbox: Modals display the title and description fetched dynamically via data- attributes.

Keyboard Navigation: Full support for navigating the gallery with Arrow Keys (Left/Right) and closing the overlay with Escape.
